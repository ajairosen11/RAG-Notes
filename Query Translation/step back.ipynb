       "'Task decomposition for Language Model (LLM) agents refers to the process of breaking down a complex task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks that can be solved independently. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex queries or tasks that require a deep understanding of language and context.\\n\\nIn the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), task decomposition is achieved through a two-step process. First, the query is transformed into an embedding vector, which is then used to perform a similarity search in a database of document vectors. This step helps to retrieve the most relevant documents related to the query.\\n\\nNext, the RAG system merges the content of the retrieved documents with the original query to form a comprehensive dataset. This dataset is then processed by a LLM model, which produces a contextually relevant response to the query.\\n\\nThe advantage of this approach is that it allows the LLM agent to harness the power of diversity by retrieving multiple sets of documents based on varied interpretations of the original query. This is particularly advantageous when dealing with queries that are vague or imprecisely formulated. By casting a wider net through multiple queries, this method markedly increases the likelihood of pinpointing the most relevant and accurate answers from the vast ocean of available information.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that the final outcome of the RAG method depends on how the query is written. Even minor variations in the query phrasing can sometimes lead to different outcomes. Therefore, it is important to carefully craft the query to ensure that the LLM agent can accurately and effectively perform the task decomposition and retrieve the most relevant and accurate answers.'"
