      "A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This occurs because the mass of the object that has collapsed to form the black hole is concentrated in an extremely small space. The boundary of the black hole, beyond which nothing can escape, is called the event horizon. Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have undergone a supernova explosion. They are called \"black\" holes because they do not emit any light and are therefore invisible to the naked eye. Despite their name, black holes play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and are an active area of research in astrophysics.\n"
